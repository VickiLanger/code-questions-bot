## Why are you doing it like this?

I could streamline this bot a lot by using [txt files as input](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files). However, one of the goals of this bot is to help Code Newbies get their first open source contributions. I want people to have the chance to make simple changes while actually learning the process of how git is working.
